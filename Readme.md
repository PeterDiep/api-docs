## PageUp Api Documentation

#### API Specification (RAML)

The repository also contains the [RAMLâ„¢ specification](https://github.com/PageUpPeopleOrg/api-docs/blob/master/pageup.raml) for the PageUp Web API. [RAML](http://raml.org/index.html) is a YAML-based language that describes RESTful APIs and provides all the information necessary to describe RESTful APIs, create API client-code and API server-code generators, and create API user documentation from RAML API definitions.
